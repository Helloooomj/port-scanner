# Basic Network Scanner
## Overview
A Python-based local network scanner designed to identify connected devices and scan for open ports on specified hosts. 
This tool provides foundational capabilities for network reconnaissance, including device discovery and port status checking.

## Features
- Scan local network to identify connected devices
- Check for open TCP ports on specified hosts
- Basic packet sniffing concepts integrated for understanding network traffic
- Useful for LAN reconnaissance and network auditing

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your machine
- Basic knowledge of networking concepts (IP addressing, ports)
- Libraries: `socket`, `time`, and optionally `scapy` (if extended)

## Limitations
- Limited to local network scanning
- Basic port scanning without threading or advanced techniques
- Does not perform in-depth packet analysis
